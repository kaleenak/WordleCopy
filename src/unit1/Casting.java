		     Why do you think these are implicit/explicit? (Hint: Think about the size of each data and the type of data)
		     This is because int the casting smaller types can go into bigger types easily(ex. int into double), but when we try to do this vice versa,
		     we can lose information as there is less space in the smaller data type. So this is why when casting a bigger type to a smaller one,
		     we must explicitly state that this what we are trying to do.
